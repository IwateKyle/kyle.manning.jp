## change ssh port from 22
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
find entry labeled as 
port 22
the port might be commented out as
#port 22
in either case, make sure entry is not commented out and change the port to the desired port.
- save the file
> systemctl restart sshd.service
- log out
- log back in.
- try logging back in with the old port number to make sure access is blocked
- try logging in with new port to make sure access as open
